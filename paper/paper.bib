abstract = {Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ({KEGG}) is a knowledge base for systematic analysis of gene functions in terms of the networks of genes and molecules. The major component of {KEGG} is the {PATHWAY} database that consists of graphical diagrams of biochemical pathways including most of the known metabolic pathways and some of the known regulatory pathways. The pathway information is also represented by the ortholog group tables summarizing orthologous and paralogous gene groups among different organisms. {KEGG} maintains the {GENES} database for the gene catalogs of all organisms with complete genomes and selected organisms with partial genomes, which are continuously re-annotated, as well as the {LIGAND} database for chemical compounds and enzymes. Each gene catalog is associated with the graphical genome map for chromosomal locations that is represented by Java applet. In addition to the data collection efforts, {KEGG} develops and provides various computational tools, such as for reconstructing biochemical pathways from the complete genome sequence and for predicting gene regulatory networks from the gene expression profiles. The {KEGG} databases are daily updated and made freely available (http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/).}

Increasing the number of correct identifications, both of genes and of the translation initiation sites for each gene, and reducing the overall number of false positives, are all desirable goals. {RESULTS}: With our years of experience in manually curating genomes for the Joint Genome Institute, we developed a new gene prediction algorithm called Prodigal ({PROkaryotic} {DYnamic} programming Gene-finding {ALgorithm}). With Prodigal, we focused specifically on the three goals of improved gene structure prediction, improved translation initiation site recognition, and reduced false positives. We compared the results of Prodigal to existing gene-finding methods to demonstrate that it met each of these objectives. {CONCLUSION}: We built a fast, lightweight, open source gene prediction program called Prodigal http://compbio.ornl.gov/prodigal/. Prodigal achieved good results compared to existing methods, and we believe it will be a valuable asset to automated microbial annotation pipelines.}

With the increased breadth of experimental designs now being pursued, project-specific statistical analyses are often needed, and these analyses are often difficult (or impossible) for peer researchers to independently reproduce. The vast majority of the requisite tools for performing these analyses reproducibly are already implemented in R and its extensions (packages), but with limited support for high throughput microbiome census data. {RESULTS}: Here we describe a software project, phyloseq, dedicated to the object-oriented representation and analysis of microbiome census data in R. It supports importing data from a variety of common formats, as well as many analysis techniques. These include calibration, filtering, subsetting, agglomeration, multi-table comparisons, diversity analysis, parallelized Fast {UniFrac}, ordination methods, and production of publication-quality graphics; all in a manner that is easy to document, share, and modify. We show how to apply functions from other R packages to phyloseq-represented data, illustrating the availability of a large number of open source analysis techniques. We discuss the use of phyloseq with tools for reproducible research, a practice common in other fields but still rare in the analysis of highly parallel microbiome census data. We have made available all of the materials necessary to completely reproduce the analysis and figures included in this article, an example of best practices for reproducible research. {CONCLUSIONS}: The phyloseq project for R is a new open-source software package, freely available on the web from both {GitHub} and Bioconductor.}

abstract = {Profile hidden Markov models (profile {HMMs}) and probabilistic inference methods have made important contributions to the theory of sequence database homology search. However, practical use of profile {HMM} methods has been hindered by the computational expense of existing software implementations. Here I describe an acceleration heuristic for profile {HMMs}, the "multiple segment Viterbi" ({MSV}) algorithm. The {MSV} algorithm computes an optimal sum of multiple ungapped local alignment segments using a striped vector-parallel approach previously described for fast Smith/Waterman alignment. {MSV} scores follow the same statistical distribution as gapped optimal local alignment scores, allowing rapid evaluation of significance of an {MSV} score and thus facilitating its use as a heuristic filter. I also describe a 20-fold acceleration of the standard profile {HMM} Forward/Backward algorithms using a method I call "sparse rescaling". These methods are assembled in a pipeline in which high-scoring {MSV} hits are passed on for reanalysis with the full {HMM} Forward/Backward algorithm. This accelerated pipeline is implemented in the freely available {HMMER3} software package. Performance benchmarks show that the use of the heuristic {MSV} filter sacrifices negligible sensitivity compared to unaccelerated profile {HMM} searches. {HMMER3} is substantially more sensitive and 100- to 1000-fold faster than {HMMER2}. {HMMER3} is now about as fast as {BLAST} for protein searches.}

Relative to pure translated search, {HUMAnN2} is faster and produces more accurate gene family profiles. We applied {HUMAnN2} to study clinal variation in marine metabolism, ecological contribution patterns among human microbiome pathways, variation in species' genomic versus transcriptional contributions, and strain profiling. Further, we introduce 'contributional diversity' to explain patterns of ecological assembly across different microbial community types.}

abstract = {Metagenomic sequencing has greatly improved our ability to profile the composition of environmental and host-associated microbial communities. However, the dependency of most methods on reference genomes, which are currently unavailable for a substantial fraction of microbial species, introduces estimation biases. We present an updated and functionally extended tool based on universal (i.e., reference-independent), phylogenetic marker gene ({MG})-based operational taxonomic units ({mOTUs}) enabling the profiling of \textgreater7700 microbial species. As more than 30\% of them could not previously be quantified at this taxonomic resolution, relative abundance estimates based on {mOTUs} are more accurate compared to other methods. As a new feature, we show that {mOTUs}, which are based on essential housekeeping genes, are demonstrably well-suited for quantification of basal transcriptional activity of community members. Furthermore, single nucleotide variation profiles estimated using {mOTUs} reflect those from whole genomes, which allows for comparing microbial strain populations (e.g., across different human body sites).}

abstract = {Molecular chaperones of the Hsp70 family form an important hub in the cellular protein folding networks in bacteria and eukaryotes, connecting translation with the downstream machineries of protein folding and degradation. The Hsp70 folding cycle is driven by two types of cochaperones: J-domain proteins stimulate {ATP} hydrolysis by Hsp70, while nucleotide exchange factors ({NEFs}) promote replacement of Hsp70-bound {ADP} with {ATP}. Bacteria and organelles of bacterial origin have only one known {NEF} type for Hsp70, {GrpE}. In contrast, a large diversity of Hsp70 {NEFs} has been discovered in the eukaryotic cell. These {NEFs} belong to the Hsp110/Grp170, {HspBP1}/Sil1, and {BAG} domain protein families.

abstract = {Since the first genome-scale comparisons, it has been evident that the genomes of many species are unbound by strict vertical descent: Large differences in gene content can occur among genomes belonging to the same prokaryotic species, with only a fraction of genes being universal to all genomes. These insights gave rise to the pangenome concept. The pangenome is defined as the set of all the genes present in a given species and can be subdivided into the accessory genome, present in only some of the genomes, and the core genome, present in all the genomes. Pangenomes arise due to gene gain by genomes from other species through horizontal gene transfer and differential gene loss among genomes, and have been described in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Our current view of pangenome variation is phenomenological and incomplete. In this review, we outline the mechanistic, ecological and evolutionary drivers of and barriers to horizontal gene transfer that are likely to structure pangenomes. We highlight the key role of conflict between the host chromosome(s) and the mobile genetic elements that mediate gene exchange. We identify shortcomings in our current models of pangenome evolution and suggest directions for future research to allow a more complete understanding of how and why pangenomes evolve.

If those parameters are not chosen properly, binning accuracy can suffer, especially on assemblies of poor quality. Here, we developed {MetaBAT} 2 to overcome this problem. {MetaBAT} 2 uses a new adaptive binning algorithm to eliminate manual parameter tuning. We also performed extensive software engineering optimization to increase both computational and memory efficiency. Comparing {MetaBAT} 2 to alternative software tools on over 100 real world metagenome assemblies shows superior accuracy and computing speed. Binning a typical metagenome assembly takes only a few minutes on a single commodity workstation. We therefore recommend the community adopts {MetaBAT} 2 for their metagenome binning experiments. {MetaBAT} 2 is open source software and available at https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/metabat.}

abstract = {The Genome Taxonomy Database ({GTDB}; https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org) provides a phylogenetically consistent and rank normalized genome-based taxonomy for prokaryotic genomes sourced from the {NCBI} Assembly database. {GTDB} R06-{RS202} spans 254 090 bacterial and 4316 archaeal genomes, a 270\% increase since the introduction of the {GTDB} in November, 2017. These genomes are organized into 45 555 bacterial and 2339 archaeal species clusters which is a 200\% increase since the integration of species clusters into the {GTDB} in June, 2019. Here, we explore prokaryotic diversity from the perspective of the {GTDB} and highlight the importance of metagenome-assembled genomes in expanding available genomic representation. We also discuss improvements to the {GTDB} website which allow tracking of taxonomic changes, easy assessment of genome assembly quality, and identification of genomes assembled from type material or used as species representatives. Methodological updates and policy changes made since the inception of the {GTDB} are then described along with the procedure used to update species clusters in the {GTDB}. We conclude with a discussion on the use of average nucleotide identities as a pragmatic approach for delineating prokaryotic species. \copyright The Author(s) 2021.

A {MAG} represents a microbial genome by a group of sequences from genome assembly with similar characteristics. It enables us to identify novel species and understand their potential functions in a dynamic ecosystem. Many computational tools have been developed to construct and annotate {MAGs} from metagenomic sequencing, however, there is a prominent gap to comprehensively introduce their background and practical performance. In this paper, we have thoroughly investigated the computational tools designed for both upstream and downstream analyses, including metagenome assembly, metagenome binning, gene prediction, functional annotation, taxonomic classification, and profiling. We have categorized the commonly used tools into unique groups based on their functional background and introduced the underlying core algorithms and associated information to demonstrate a comparative outlook. Furthermore, we have emphasized the computational requisition and offered guidance to the users to select the most efficient tools. Finally, we have indicated current limitations, potential solutions, and future perspectives for further improving the tools of {MAG} construction and annotation. We believe that our work provides a consolidated resource for the current stage of {MAG} studies and shed light on the future development of more effective {MAG} analysis tools on metagenomic sequencing. \copyright 2021 The Author(s).}

abstract = {The human gut possesses millions of microbes that define a complex microbial community. The gut microbiota has been characterized as a vital organ forming its multidirectional connecting axis with other organs. This gut microbiota axis is responsible for host-microbe interactions and works by communicating with the neural, endocrinal, humoral, immunological, and metabolic pathways. The human gut microorganisms (mostly non-pathogenic) have symbiotic host relationships and are usually associated with the host's immunity to defend against pathogenic invasion. The dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is therefore linked to various human diseases, such as anxiety, depression, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and cancer. The mechanism leading to the disease development has a crucial correlation with gut microbiota, metabolic products, and host immune response in humans. The understanding of mechanisms over gut microbiota exerts its positive or harmful impacts remains largely undefined. However, many recent clinical studies conducted worldwide are demonstrating the relation of specific microbial species and eubiosis in health and disease. A comprehensive understanding of gut microbiota interactions, its role in health and disease, and recent updates on the subject are the striking topics of the current review. We have also addressed the daunting challenges that must be brought under control to maintain health and treat diseases.

However, the growing size of the {GTDB} bacterial reference tree has resulted in {GTDB}-Tk requiring substantial amounts of memory (∼320 {GB}) which limits its adoption and ease of use. Here, we present an update to {GTDB}-Tk that uses a divide-and-conquer approach where user genomes are initially placed into a bacterial reference tree with family-level representatives followed by placement into an appropriate class-level subtree comprising species representatives. This substantially reduces the memory requirements of {GTDB}-Tk while having minimal impact on classification. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: {GTDB}-Tk is implemented in Python and licenced under the {GNU} General Public Licence v3.0.

abstract = {Carbon fixation by chemoautotrophic microorganisms in the dark ocean makes a large contribution to oceanic primary production and the global carbon cycle. In contrast to the Calvin cycle-dominated carbon-fixing pathway in the marine euphotic zone, carbon-fixing pathways and their hosts in deep-sea areas are diverse. In this study, four deep-sea sediment samples close to hydrothermal vents in the southwestern Indian Ocean were collected and processed using metagenomic analysis to investigate carbon fixation potential. Functional annotations revealed that all six carbon-fixing pathways had genes to varied degrees present in the samples. The reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle and Calvin cycle genes occurred in all samples, in contrast to the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, which previous studies found mainly in the hydrothermal area. The annotations also elucidated the chemoautotrophic microbial members associated with the six carbon-fixing pathways, and the majority of them containing key carbon fixation genes belonged to the phyla Pseudomonadota and Desulfobacterota. The binned metagenome-assembled genomes revealed that key genes for the Calvin cycle and the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle were also found in the order Rhodothermales and the family Hyphomicrobiaceae. By identifying the carbon metabolic pathways and microbial populations in the hydrothermal fields of the southwest Indian Ocean, our study sheds light on complex biogeochemical processes in deep-sea environments and lays the foundation for further in-depth investigations of carbon fixation processes in deep-sea ecosystems.

abstract = {The {grpE} gene of Escherichia coli is essential for bacteriophage lambda {DNA} replication and is also necessary for host {RNA} and {DNA} synthesis at high temperature. A {grpE} mutant of E. coli was found to be substantially more resistant to 50 degrees C heat treatment than the wild-type. Upon receiving a 42 degrees C heat shock for 15 min, both the wild-type and the {grpE} mutant became more resistant to heat (i.e. they became thermotolerant). A {grpE}+ revertant behaved similarly to the wild-type in that it was more sensitive to heat than {grpE} cells. In addition, {grpE} cells had the same {H2O2} and {UV} sensitivity as the wild-type. This implies that the conditions for which a {grpE} mutation is beneficial are unique to heat exposure and are not caused by {H2O2} or {UV} exposure. Furthermore, synthesis of heat-shock proteins occurred sooner in the {grpE} mutant than in the wild-type, indicating that the {grpE} gene of E. coli may influence the regulation of the heat-shock response.}
