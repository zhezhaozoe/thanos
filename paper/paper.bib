abstract = {Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ({KEGG}) is a knowledge base for systematic analysis of gene functions in terms of the networks of genes and molecules. The major component of {KEGG} is the {PATHWAY} database that consists of graphical diagrams of biochemical pathways including most of the known metabolic pathways and some of the known regulatory pathways. The pathway information is also represented by the ortholog group tables summarizing orthologous and paralogous gene groups among different organisms. {KEGG} maintains the {GENES} database for the gene catalogs of all organisms with complete genomes and selected organisms with partial genomes, which are continuously re-annotated, as well as the {LIGAND} database for chemical compounds and enzymes. Each gene catalog is associated with the graphical genome map for chromosomal locations that is represented by Java applet. In addition to the data collection efforts, {KEGG} develops and provides various computational tools, such as for reconstructing biochemical pathways from the complete genome sequence and for predicting gene regulatory networks from the gene expression profiles. The {KEGG} databases are daily updated and made freely available (http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/).}

abstract = {{UNLABELLED}: The multiplex capability and high yield of current day {DNA}-sequencing instruments has made bacterial whole genome sequencing a routine affair. The subsequent de novo assembly of reads into contigs has been well addressed. The final step of annotating all relevant genomic features on those contigs can be achieved slowly using existing web- and email-based systems, but these are not applicable for sensitive data or integrating into computational pipelines. Here we introduce Prokka, a command line software tool to fully annotate a draft bacterial genome in about 10 min on a typical desktop computer. It produces standards-compliant output files for further analysis or viewing in genome browsers. {AVAILABILITY} {AND} {IMPLEMENTATION}: Prokka is implemented in Perl and is freely available under an open source {GPLv2} license from http://vicbioinformatics.com/. \copyright The Author 2014.

abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: the analysis of microbial communities through dna sequencing brings many challenges: the integration of different types of data with methods from ecology, genetics, phylogenetics, multivariate statistics, visualization and testing. With the increased breadth of experimental designs now being pursued, project-specific statistical analyses are often needed, and these analyses are often difficult (or impossible) for peer researchers to independently reproduce. The vast majority of the requisite tools for performing these analyses reproducibly are already implemented in R and its extensions (packages), but with limited support for high throughput microbiome census data. {RESULTS}: Here we describe a software project, phyloseq, dedicated to the object-oriented representation and analysis of microbiome census data in R. It supports importing data from a variety of common formats, as well as many analysis techniques. These include calibration, filtering, subsetting, agglomeration, multi-table comparisons, diversity analysis, parallelized Fast {UniFrac}, ordination methods, and production of publication-quality graphics; all in a manner that is easy to document, share, and modify. We show how to apply functions from other R packages to phyloseq-represented data, illustrating the availability of a large number of open source analysis techniques. We discuss the use of phyloseq with tools for reproducible research, a practice common in other fields but still rare in the analysis of highly parallel microbiome census data. We have made available all of the materials necessary to completely reproduce the analysis and figures included in this article, an example of best practices for reproducible research. {CONCLUSIONS}: The phyloseq project for R is a new open-source software package, freely available on the web from both {GitHub} and Bioconductor.}

abstract = {Profile hidden Markov models (profile {HMMs}) and probabilistic inference methods have made important contributions to the theory of sequence database homology search. However, practical use of profile {HMM} methods has been hindered by the computational expense of existing software implementations. Here I describe an acceleration heuristic for profile {HMMs}, the "multiple segment Viterbi" ({MSV}) algorithm. The {MSV} algorithm computes an optimal sum of multiple ungapped local alignment segments using a striped vector-parallel approach previously described for fast Smith/Waterman alignment. {MSV} scores follow the same statistical distribution as gapped optimal local alignment scores, allowing rapid evaluation of significance of an {MSV} score and thus facilitating its use as a heuristic filter. I also describe a 20-fold acceleration of the standard profile {HMM} Forward/Backward algorithms using a method I call "sparse rescaling". These methods are assembled in a pipeline in which high-scoring {MSV} hits are passed on for reanalysis with the full {HMM} Forward/Backward algorithm. This accelerated pipeline is implemented in the freely available {HMMER3} software package. Performance benchmarks show that the use of the heuristic {MSV} filter sacrifices negligible sensitivity compared to unaccelerated profile {HMM} searches. {HMMER3} is substantially more sensitive and 100- to 1000-fold faster than {HMMER2}. {HMMER3} is now about as fast as {BLAST} for protein searches.}

abstract = {Even though automated functional annotation of genes represents a fundamental step in most genomic and metagenomic workflows, it remains challenging at large scales. Here, we describe a major upgrade to {eggNOG}-mapper, a tool for functional annotation based on precomputed orthology assignments, now optimized for vast (meta)genomic data sets. Improvements in version 2 include a full update of both the genomes and functional databases to those from {eggNOG} v5, as well as several efficiency enhancements and new features. Most notably, {eggNOG}-mapper v2 now allows for: 1) de novo gene prediction from raw contigs, 2) built-in pairwise orthology prediction, 3) fast protein domain discovery, and 4) automated {GFF} decoration. {eggNOG}-mapper v2 is available as a standalone tool or as an online service at http://eggnog-mapper.embl.de. \copyright The Author(s) 2021.

abstract = {The Genome Taxonomy Database ({GTDB}; https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org) provides a phylogenetically consistent and rank normalized genome-based taxonomy for prokaryotic genomes sourced from the {NCBI} Assembly database. {GTDB} R06-{RS202} spans 254 090 bacterial and 4316 archaeal genomes, a 270\% increase since the introduction of the {GTDB} in November, 2017. These genomes are organized into 45 555 bacterial and 2339 archaeal species clusters which is a 200\% increase since the integration of species clusters into the {GTDB} in June, 2019. Here, we explore prokaryotic diversity from the perspective of the {GTDB} and highlight the importance of metagenome-assembled genomes in expanding available genomic representation. We also discuss improvements to the {GTDB} website which allow tracking of taxonomic changes, easy assessment of genome assembly quality, and identification of genomes assembled from type material or used as species representatives. Methodological updates and policy changes made since the inception of the {GTDB} are then described along with the procedure used to update species clusters in the {GTDB}. We conclude with a discussion on the use of average nucleotide identities as a pragmatic approach for delineating prokaryotic species. \copyright The Author(s) 2021.

abstract = {Metagenomics is a new approach to study microorganisms obtained from a specific environment by functional gene screening or sequencing analysis. Metagenomics studies focus on microbial diversity, community constitute, genetic and evolutionary relationships, functional activities, and interactions and relationships with the environment. Sequencing technologies have evolved from shotgun sequencing to high-throughput, next-generation sequencing ({NGS}), and third-generation sequencing ({TGS}). {NGS} and {TGS} have shown the advantage of rapid detection of pathogenic microorganisms. With the help of new algorithms, we can better perform the taxonomic profiling and gene prediction of microbial species. Functional metagenomics is helpful to screen new bioactive substances and new functional genes from microorganisms and microbial metabolites. In this article, basic steps, classification, and applications of metagenomics are reviewed. Copyright \copyright 2021 Zhang, Chen, Zeng, Xu, Sun, Yang, Bi, Lin, Gao, Hao, Yi, Li and Xie.}
